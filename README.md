This project presents a Python program that implements Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Vertex Coloring algorithms on a connected acyclic graph. 
The program takes an input file containing the graph structure and outputs the BFS and DFS traversal order, as well as the vertex coloring of the graph according to the user's choice from the menu.

The BFS algorithm starts at a given root node and explores all nodes at a given level before moving on to the next level. 
The DFS algorithm explores the graph by following a single path as far as possible before backtracking to explore other paths. 
The vertex coloring algorithm assigns a color to each vertex such that no adjacent vertices have the same color.

The project makes extensive use of the tkinter and networkx libraries.
